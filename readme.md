# jenkins zero to hero course

- this repo contains byproducts of the course and notes from section 6 and
after.
- actually, I'll include the old note here as well. [pre section 6
note](/note_pre_section6.md)

## ansible

- automation tool (leverage ssh and scripting).
- this thing is written in python.
  - my take is that python is not that great.
  - now you have to install python on your server in order to manage it? I
  would definitely avoid that. wait a minute, jenkins is written in java, which
  is not that great, but fine.
  - wait once more, they are all using ssh to manage production servers. I
  would not have to install python or java, I just need python/java on the
  server that runs jenkins/ansible. hmmâ€¦ this is acceptable now.
  - I would still prefer these kind of tools should be written in compiled
  language like C, zig, so on.
- main feature of this tool is to make managing multiple machines easy.
- help describe the whole infrastructure in yaml (supposedly to be both human
and machine friendly).

# jenkins zero to hero course

- this repo contains byproducts of the course and notes from section 6 and
after.
- actually, I'll include the old note here as well. [pre section 6
note](/note_pre_section6.md)

## ansible (section 6)

- automation tool (leverage ssh and scripting).
- this thing is written in python.
  - my take is that python is not that great.
  - now you have to install python on your server in order to manage it? I
  would definitely avoid that. Wait a minute, jenkins is written in java, which
  is not that great, but fine.
  - wait once more, they are all using ssh to manage production servers. I
  would not have to install python or java, I just need python/java on the
  server that runs jenkins/ansible. Hmmâ€¦ this is acceptable now.
  - I would still prefer these kind of tools should be written in compiled
  language like C, zig, so on.
- main feature of this tool is to make managing multiple machines easy.
- help describe the whole infrastructure in yaml (supposedly to be both human
and machine friendly).

- I don't think install ansible using pip method as in the course is good. The
jenkins image based on debian, so you can just `apt install ansible-core`, and
you're good to go.
- oh, they have a note says to use venv to create virtual env and install there
instead of install globally using pip. This is better but still, just use the
debian package instead.
- I hate incompetent.

- nginx is a really popular piece of software, it is included in pretty much
every linux distrubutions. Why do you have to add a repo in order to install
it? At least, I don't have to. Since my rockylinux has it.
- the same with php-fpm.

## security (section 7)

- even for security we have plugins. I thought jenkins would have to manage
this aspect 100%. The course even states that jenkins' default security is
weak. But I think the base security is pretty much enough for most users.
- role-based authen plugin? to add the functionalities similar to aws IAM? I
see, I can understand aws and gcp better. Instead of letting amazon or google
manage everything, we'll setup ourself.

## tips & tricks (section 8)

- jenkins has some default global variables to show information like
BUILD_NUMBER. Ofc we can create out own global vairables.

- in each job's configuration, we can config the build triggers. We can trigger
a job in multiple ways, like a cronjob for example.
  - we can use api to trigger jobs, similar to google scheduler.

## email (section 9)

- basically add smtp information from email service provider and send email.
- aws ses is acceptable, but gmail seems like a bad idea. Google mail service
is the main service of Google, they are trying their best to prevent people
host their own mail service.
- I prefer to create my own smtp server for this course. It's not that hard,
the only hardship is to make gmail not mark emails from my server as spams.
- after setted up emails, you can have notifications about jobs now.

## git (section 11)

Tasks:
    1. Create git-server host in docker-compose file using gitlab.
    2. Create git repo: (1) create group; (2) create repo.
    3. Create a regular user.
    4. Push something on the repo.

You create git hook by ssh into the gitserver and create the script in the
repo's directory? I don't think this is a good idea.

## DSL (section 12)

Tasks:
    1. Install job dsl plugin.

A job to manage multiple jobs in DSL style. DSL is good. Text is better than
GUI.

## CI/CD (section 13)

- This section has nothing but some definitions of Continuous
  Integration/Delivery/Deployment. I've read enough Redhat blogs about this
  topic.

## Jenkinsfile (section 14)

This course introduced some tools with syntax: ansible, DSL plugins,
jenkinsfile.

Jenkinsfile: still a declarative language to declare pipelines. We have the
concept of stages (e.g. build, test, deploy). Inside of a stage, we have
multiple steps.

Groovy: JVM based language. This thing helps make run scripts more declarative.
And it also integrate better with jenkins, instead of running shell scripts. In
order to write jenkins file, we use this language.

Pipeline is also a plugin.

## Build Jenkinsfile with `real` steps (Section 15)

Docker inside docker. We can use the docker inside a docker to control host's
containers. The method is map the sock from host to the container containing
the docker. :v Pretty funny but this method is discouraged now since we have
more secure methods of doing this concept.

We have kubernetes, external clusters and can use jenkins to manage them.

Write scripts to automate everything, from create image to run container, and
push to docker hub.
